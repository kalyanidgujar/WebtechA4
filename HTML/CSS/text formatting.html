    <p>The warm sun woke me up this morning,<br>
         and I hope it's not cheesy to say that it reminded me of your smile. <br>
         Hoping your morning (and day) is incredible. <br>
         Spent a lot of time thinking about you last night, and I can't wait to see you today. <br>
         Hope you have a great morning!
    </p>
    <h1>Good Morning</h1>
